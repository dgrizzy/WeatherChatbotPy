Hi, thank you so much for a great semester. I really enjoyed the project, and
hope that you do too.

To run the file, please unpack the zip file then navigate to final_chatter.py in
your terminal to run. After, please say hello and introduce yourself to the bot.

All of the files in the ZIP must be present to run.

Per the specs, my program supports caching with the city name as the key and the
darksky data as the value. My program loads the data and will run right now
without WIFI for the following cities: Kalamazoo, beijing, Travers City, East Lansing,
Ypsilanti, Paris, Dubai, Detroit, Ann Arbor, Grand Rapids, Muskegon, and katmandu.
Any additional cities will require an internet connection.

Really hope you have fun and enjoy the bot!
